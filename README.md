# Movie Trailer App (Fresh Tomatoes)

A Python app consisting of six of my favorite movies.

## Download
You can download this app via git:

`git clone https://github.com/cqaxo/movie_trailers.git`

## How to Use
1. To use this Python app you first need to install Python (Runs on both python2 and python3)
2. Run entertainment_center.py with your Python interpreter (`$ python entertainment_center.py`)
3. The `entertainment_center.py` script will generate a HTML page, which will automatically load into your current web browser. (If the app doesn't automatically load into your web browser, just open the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file that is generated by `fresh_tomatoes.py` in order to view the app).
4. That's it!

## About
This app was built as a project for the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Program.
